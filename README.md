# 🌟 **Players Counter Mod** 🌟

Adds a sleek, customizable player counter to the top-left corner of your screen, displaying the current number of players in the room and the maximum player limit. Perfect for keeping track of your squad in real-time!

---

## 📝 **Features**
- **Real-Time Player Count**: Displays the current number of players and the max limit (e.g., "3/10 Players").
- **Custom Max Players**: Automatically reads the `MaxPlayers` value from `zelofi.MorePlayers.cfg` (if available) or defaults to the vanilla limit of 6.
- **Seamless UI Integration**: Blends perfectly with the game’s UI, inheriting post-processing effects like grain for a natural look.
- **Top-Left Positioning**: Strategically placed to avoid clashing with other UI elements like health bars or chat.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Adjust text color, size, and outline in the code to match your preferences.
